 * @cubiczan/forge-core — shared plumbing for Atlassian Forge apps.
 *
 * Extracted from the common scaffold across decision-brief, finance-cockpit,
 * and market-radar. App-specific resolver functions and payload shapes stay in
 * each app; this package provides the reusable wiring:
 *
 *   - verifyWebhook / createWebhookHandler : fail-closed HMAC webtrigger auth
 *   - createResolver / readCache / writeCache / pick : proxy->cache->mock chain
 *   - ok / fail / methodNotAllowed / invalidJson : response envelopes
 *   - fetchWithTimeout : dependency-free fetch + AbortController timeout
